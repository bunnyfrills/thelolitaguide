  <h3>Is __ Ita? Is __ Lolita?</h3>
  <p style="padding: 3px 14px 7px 14px"> All questions and answers are based on things I see frequently asked on Lolita forums. These are all my opinions, so take
    everything with a grain of salt.<i> Tip: If you have a specific question, hit ctrl+f and type in a keyword related to your question. That will help you find
        your specific answer faster.</i></p> </div>

  <div id="itaquestions">
      <ul>
        <p>Let's start by first discussing what "ita" is. The term comes from the Japanese word "ittai," which is like saying "ow" or "ouch." In terms of Lolita,
            the term specifically refers to something in a coordinate (outfit) that is painful to look at. This may be because an item is low quality, not coorded
            (paired within your outfit) well, or is not within the realms of what Lolita Fashion is.<br><br>It is important to note that when providing feedback on an outfit,
            calling something "ita" is not constructive or helpful to the person looking to improve. It communicates nothing, as it can refer to the variety of categories we
            listed out before, and some simply use it to mean that something does not appeal to their personal style.<br><br>So when is the term useful? The short answer is
            probably never. A lot of newbie lolitas see community specific jargon being used on forums, and assume they are common to use. However, the actual truth is that some
            terms are rarely used anymore and often only linger due to having a history within the community. For example, let's take the term "Kodona." It was used in the past to
            refer to what we now call "Ouji," and while you may sometimes see people still use Kodona, this is rare, especially due to some negative connotations the term now has. 
            Some people who use these terms were in the community years ago, left, and came back recently, and others simply never got out of the habit.<br><br>Ita came about as a
            term in time when lolita was much less accessible. Few, if any, Chinese indie brands existed, meaning you had to spend triple digits to buy a single dress if you wanted
            it to be brand new. The western community at one point was primarily on Livejournal, comprised of teenagers who were discovering the fashion through streetsnaps and
            (sometimes badly) translated clips of Japanese Lolitas discussing the style. On top of that, few people outside of the community actually had an accurate idea of what
            the fashion was, which led to many anime fans trying to wear the fashion, and doing so very, very incorrectly. As such, terms like "ita" came about to quickly identify
            coords that resembled the fashion very little if at all. For example, if someone wore a short Old Navy skirt with no petticoat, a cheap and generic cami top, sandals,
            no socks, and a mini hat purchased from Spirit Halloween that was falling apart just a month later, the community could quickly identify the coord as "ita".<br><br>
            Essentially, the term has little meaning now in an age where pages just like this exist, where subreddits and facebook groups cater specifically to newbies in order to
            help them build up wardrobes that will look good and last. However, some stigmas related to things previously seen as "ita" remain, which we will breakdown now.</p>
