                <p>
              Alice (designer): designer who used to work for Moitie. She was the mind behind a lot of iconic Moitie pieces, such as the <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/moitie-rosicrucian-jumper-skirt">Rose Cross JSK</a><br>
              A-line: skirts and petticoats that are shaped like an uppercase A.<br>
              Barette: small head accessories using a clasp.<br>
              Behind the bows: a forum used to post confessions, gossip, and opinions anonymously. Now defunct.<br>
              bodice: the top part of the dress that accomodates your bust (and often waist).<br>
              bloomers: pumpkin pants/shorts that go under your skirt. Used most often in Old School lolita, or when a dress is too short.<br>

              Canotier: Circular headdress that is tied around the chin and usually rests at a tilted position on the upper head.<br>
              CGL: 4chan forum for lolita. Very toxic with a tendency to post others' coords to make fun of. Sometimes leaks related to releases happen there. Not a good representation of the community, a lot of people on there don't even wear the fashion.<br>
              cage skirt: kind of like a petticoat, but instead of using ruffles of fabric to give volume to a skirt, it uses stiff hoops. Also referred to as crinolines and hoop skirts. Recommended to be worn instead of pettticoats during the summer and in areas that tend to be hotter.<br>
              Colorway: the color version of a dress. For example, <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/ap-happy-garland-jsk-0">Happy Garland</a> has several colorways, including pink, sax, yellow, and white.
              comm: short for community, they are local communities of lolitas that meet up often while wearing the fashion.<br>
              comm meet: an event hosted by at least one (local) lolita community member, in which everyone meets up while wearing the fashion.<br>
              cutsew: a blouse that uses t-shirt like material. Often used in casual lolita.<br>

              dream dress: Someone's favorite dress that they are searching for on the secondhand market. People are usually willing to pay above retail or market price for this item.<br>

              lucky bag: A bag of random items from a brand that sells for cheaper than the items' combined retail value, usually sold at the end of the year or at the beginning of the new year. Other times, they are bags containing special sets exclusive to those packs. It is not recommended to buy the randomized ones, as they usually contain whatever stock did not sell well (AKA something you are unlikely to want) that year.<br>
              Malice Mizer: Visual Kei band that was together from 1992 to 2001. Many original and current lolitas were/are big fans of them.<br>

              Raschel lace: type of netted lace used most often in older pieces or by the brand Marble. Sometimes frowned upon due to the association it has with replicas in the early 2000s that used cheaply produced Raschel lace to cut corners.<br>
              Risa: one of Angelic Pretty's current models. <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/ap-happy-treat-party-op">Here</a> she is modeling Happy Treat Party OP.<br>
