                <h4>Devilinspired</h4>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The great DevilInspired question: is Devilinspired a Scam?</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The short answer: not exactly. If you order from them, you will receive something, and it'll <i>probably</i> be what you ordered. However, 
                    <b>I strongly advise you not to shop from DevilInspired</b> for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What <i>is</i> DevilInspired and how does it work?<p>DevilInspired is a Taobao Reseller, a type of store front that finds and sells listings 
                    from Chinese brands and factories on the Chinese marketplace "Taobao" (think amazon, or ebay-- marketplaces where anyone can set up a store and
                     sell things they produce).<br><br>Chinese Indie brands are a big part of Lolita nowadays. There are hundreds of them, and they all work to produce 
                     Lolita in a variety of styles and typically at a much lower price point than Japanese brands-- all while maintaining high enough quality for the fashion. 
                     However, stores on typically Taobao cater solely to Chinese consumers, and while a select few countries can buy directly from Taobao, it remains difficult 
                     to do so due to the site and listings being entirely in Chinese, brands typically not speaking other languages, and the way these brands tend to format 
                     preorders as deposits and final prices. This is where the reseller part of "Taobao Reseller" comes: resellers are stores that find brands on Taobao, 
                     translate their listings, and take orders for those listings on their own websites. Once you place an order from a Reseller, they will purchase directly 
                     from the Chinese brand on your behalf, and will ship out your ordered items once they arrive at the reseller's warehouse. Essentially, resellers make Chinese
                      brands accessible to overseas fans who would normally be unable to shop from them. So why is DevilInspired bad?<br><br>The first answer is their pricing. 
                      Resellers will typically charge a markup on the items from these brands, in order to cover the costs of having employees that translate listings, process orders, 
                      and pack your items to ship to you. However, DevilInspired's pricing is excessive at best, and (allegedly) scam-like at worst. While other resellers may charge a 
                      $10-15 markup on an item, DevilInspired often charges twice the amount of an item's original retail price! Let's take <a href="">this</a> jumperskirt for example, 
                      from the brand "Nikki Tomorrow." The original dress listing had a final, total price of 70 USD. DevilInspired was charging 115 USD for the same dress. That is a 45 
                      USD difference, enough to add a second, simpler dress to your order, or several accessories, or a pair of shoes!</li>
                  <li>Okay, but DevilInspired is so much easier than browsing through hundreds of brands and their listings that I can't even read due to the language barrier!<p>Sure, 
                    this may be true to some extent, however, that is only case under two assumptions: 1) No other company is offering a similar service, and 2) DevilInspired's only 
                    downside is the pricing of listings.<br><br>Unfortunately, neither of these  are true. Let's start with the first point: is Devilinspired the only available Lolita 
                    reseller? <b>No!</b> In fact, some stores have had a longer history within the community. Here are some stores most lolitas recommend that charge lower markups on 
                    items: <a href="">42Lolita</a>, <a href="">Lolita Wardrobe</a>, and <a href="">ClobbaOnline</a>.<br><br>Onto the second point: DevilInspired's only issue is their 
                    markup, which is made up for by their convenience. If this were true, DevilInspired would not experience the level of vitriol they do from so much of the community. 
                    It is important to recognize that advice from the Lolita Community typically comes from a place of wanting to spare other people from making the same mistakes more 
                    experienced members have made-- and especially sparing people who are just starting out! So, why else are they hated? The answer is awful, and sometimes dangerous, 
                    customer service.<br><br>Scrolling through the Lolita Subreddit brings up posts on an almost weekly basis of people asking for help receiving refunds from Devilinspired, 
                    who have a habit of sending people the wrong items, not updating people properly on the status of a preorder (e.g. if a preorder will now four months longer than 
                    anticipated, you should be notified), listing items as in stock when they have been out of stock for weeks or even months, ignoring customer requests for refunds, 
                    and more.<br><br>In one documented case, DevilInspired sent two customers the wrong packages. Typically, this is solved by contacting each customer individually, 
                    and asking each of them to send the package back to the store, so that they may then send it to the correct customer. This is done for the sake of protecting a 
                    customer's private details-- such as their full name, phone number, and address. However, in this case, DevilInspired gave both customers the addresses of the other 
                    customer and asked them each to send the package to the other. <i>This is not okay, as it can possibly lead to one person leaking the others' personal details, 
                        trying to meet with them in person, or even try to physically harm them!</i></li>
                <li>Okay, but I have never had an issue with them, so why should I stop purchasing from DevilInspired?
                  <p>There are a few angles I want to approach this question from. First, Let's go back to the first point-- the markup. Sure, you haven't had an issue with DevilInspired, 
                    but what if it happens a single time, and you are unable to obtain a refund or your items? When items can be listed as high as 2x their original price, that is a large 
                    amount of money to lose even from a small order of a single item compared to what issues you might run into buying elsewhere! Plus, the chance of an issue occuring is 
                    higher with DevilInspired, so why not use a trusted service that has a much lower rate of customer service trouble?<br><br>Now, let's move onto some moral dilemmas. 
                    Again, we must refer to earlier points-- DevilInpsired is a <b>reseller</b>, they do not make or own the clothes they sell in almost every case. And yet, they charge 
                    an extremely high markup compared to other store fronts. Where is this money going? Only the price of the original listing itself and the domestic (within China) shipping 
                    cost goes to the original brand. Essentially, as far as we know, DevilInspired is pocketing, at times, double of what an item is worth. If we factor in how many orders are
                     placed for a single item and multiply that by the profit they make from a single listing, it highly outweights the cost to translate and take orders for an item. Therefore,
                      Devilinspired is profitting off the creative work of Chinese Indie Brands who most of the time are not aware that they list the brand's items on their storefront.<br><br>
                      This becomes more troubling when we look at recent efforts DevilInspired made to limit peoples' abilities to use their catalog to browse and then buy the same items 
                      elsewhere. To combat this practice, they obscured brand names from every listing. In order to know the name of the brand that made the item you are buying, you had
                       to look at the specific item number (SKU) of the listing, and then reference the letters in it to match it to brand names listed on their brand category page. For 
                       example, if they listed an item from the brand Summer Fairy, rather than stating that on the listing page, it would simply list an item SKU of SF-####. You would 
                       then have to cross reference the initials on their expansive page of brands. Not only does this disrespect the original Chinese brands and make it so Lolitas are less 
                       likely to state what brands their items are from in their coord breakdowns (lists of what brands each item in an outfit is), it also made it more likely for a starting 
                       lolita to think DevilInspired designs and produces their listings. In fact, I often see coord breakdowns list dresses and blouses as being from the brand "Devilinspired."
                        That is simply incorrect, and minimizes the impact Chinese Lolitas have in our community!</p>
